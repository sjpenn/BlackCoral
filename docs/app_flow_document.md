# BLACK CORAL App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand-new user first visits the BLACK CORAL application, they arrive at the landing page which highlights the platform’s purpose and prompts them to create an account or sign in. To register, the user clicks the sign-up link and is presented with fields for their name, work email, password, and role selection. They submit this form and receive a confirmation email with a verification link. Once they click the link, their account is activated and they are directed to the sign-in page. Signing in requires entering the registered email and password. If the user loses their password, they click the “Forgot Password” link, enter their email, and receive a reset link. Following that link allows them to set a new password and return to the login screen. Social login via Google is available as an alternative method; clicking the Google button opens an OAuth flow, and upon successful authentication, the user is redirected into BLACK CORAL without further credentials. Signing out can be done at any time by clicking the profile avatar in the top-right corner and selecting the “Sign Out” option, which returns them to the landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After successfully signing in, the user lands on a role-specific dashboard. Administrators see a filters panel where they can define and manage criteria such as NAICS codes, agencies, titles, and capability sets. Researchers are greeted with a list of recently retrieved opportunities highlighted by status badges and inline AI summaries. Reviewers find a queue of pending proposal reviews with quick links to those detailed views. Compliance monitors and quality assurance specialists share a live status board showing ongoing checks and open flags. Submission agents see a consolidated list of proposals awaiting final assembly and submission confirmation. Across all roles, the top header displays the user’s name and role, the left sidebar holds navigation links for Opportunities, Evaluations, Partner Matching, Alerts, Settings, and Help, and the central area presents dynamic widgets and tables updated in real time via HTMX.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user clicks the “Opportunities” link in the sidebar, they transition to the filtering interface. Here, administrators or researchers select up to twenty-five NAICS codes from a searchable dropdown that automatically expands to include all related codes. As filters such as title keywords, agency names, or edge-case tags are entered, the opportunity list below updates instantly without a full page reload thanks to HTMX. Each row in this list displays the solicitation title, issuing agency, a brief AI summary, and colored status indicators for new, under evaluation, or flagged items. Clicking on an opportunity row takes the user to the Detailed Evaluation view.

Within the Detailed Evaluation view, the full Statement of Work or Performance Work Statement appears in a scrollable panel. Adjacent to each requirement, an AI-generated summary and a past-performance match score are displayed. Users can rate their confidence in a go/no-go decision and, if needed, launch a partner search workflow by clicking a link that opens a side panel. In this panel, partner profiles are matched side by side with requirement descriptions, and match confidence scores can be adjusted inline. Below the main panels, a tabbed section pulls in live data from USASpending.gov, GAO reports, congressional forecasts, and OSDBU initiative pages. Each tab loads its content on demand and refreshes with the latest API data. To fetch attached documents such as PDFs, Word files, HTML pages, ZIP folders, or spreadsheets, the user clicks “Retrieve Documents.” The system automatically downloads and parses those files, performing OCR on scanned content and indexing metadata. Extracted text and original files are saved to the local database, and links appear inline next to each document row, allowing the user to view or download source material.

From the evaluation screen, users navigate to the AI Drafting feature by selecting “Generate Draft.” This triggers background AI writing agents that populate initial narrative sections for capabilities, solution concepts, and past performance directly in the shared knowledge base. When the draft is ready, junior writer agents refine it. All edits appear immediately in the interface via HTMX partial updates. Compliance monitor agents run continuously and flag any regulatory issues inline, highlighting non-compliant text with a colored underline. Quality assurance agents simultaneously scan for grammar and style, suggesting fixes that appear as tooltips on hover. Users can accept or ignore suggestions, and the changes are saved without reloading the page. Once drafting and checks are complete, the submission agent clicks “Finalize Proposal” to assemble the full document, triggering a final automated compliance scan. Any remaining flags are displayed in a popup that must be resolved before proceeding. Finally, the agent confirms metadata—such as submission date, agency code, and contact information—and clicks “Submit to Agency.” A confirmation message appears and a submission log record is created.

## Settings and Account Management

Users access account settings by clicking their profile avatar and choosing “Settings.” The Settings page is divided into Personal Information and Notification Preferences sections. In the Personal Information section, users update their name, email, phone number, and password. Changing the password requires entering the current password and confirming the new one. Notification Preferences allow users to toggle email alerts for new opportunities, compliance flags, review assignments, or final submission confirmations. Administrators have an additional tab for Role Management. In that tab, they view the list of users and assign roles—Admin, Researcher, Reviewer, Compliance Monitor, Quality Assurance, or Submission Agent. Role changes update permissions immediately, and any affected users are notified via email. After making changes, users click “Save” to apply updates and are returned to the dashboard.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If a user submits invalid data—such as an improperly formatted email during sign-up or a required field left blank—the form displays inline error messages beneath each field and highlights the erroneous fields in red. Should the external API calls to sam.gov or USASpending.gov fail due to connectivity issues, the corresponding UI section shows a banner message explaining the outage and offers a “Retry” button. Document parsing errors, such as corrupted files or unsupported formats, appear as a modal explaining the problem and listing the files that failed to import, with an option to reattempt. When a user without sufficient permissions tries to access an admin-only page, they are redirected to a “Permission Denied” page with instructions to contact an administrator. During lengthy AI operations, the interface displays a spinner and progress message, and if the operation times out, an alert banner suggests checking network connectivity or contacting support.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From first visiting the landing page to final proposal submission, the BLACK CORAL application guides users through a seamless, role-based journey. New users sign up or log in effortlessly, recover lost passwords when needed, and land on a dashboard tailored to their responsibilities. Administrators configure opportunity filters, researchers evaluate solicitations in depth, partner matches are made, and AI-driven drafting accelerates content creation. Continuous compliance and quality checks ensure issues are caught early, and final assembly and submission are controlled by the submission agent. Through dynamic HTMX updates, real-time API integrations, and clear error handling, BLACK CORAL delivers an efficient, concurrent workflow that transforms a linear proposal process into a dynamic, collaborative environment.
