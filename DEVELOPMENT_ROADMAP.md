## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Page load times < 300ms
- HTMX partial updates < 200ms
- API response times < 1 second
- 99.5% uptime availability
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### Business Metrics
- 50% reduction in proposal preparation time
- 90% compliance accuracy rate
- 75% user adoption rate
- 95% user satisfaction score
- 100% regulatory compliance maintained

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement caching and exponential backoff
- **Document Parsing Failures**: Fallback to manual review processes
- **AI Service Downtime**: Multiple AI provider fallbacks
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization and indexing
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and updates

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Comprehensive training and support
- **Regulatory Changes**: Flexible configuration system
- **Data Quality**: Automated validation and cleanup processes
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Regular demos and feedback sessions
- **Scope Creep**: Strict phase-based development approach
